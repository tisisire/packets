func Examples

func Examples(files ...*ast.File) []*Example

Examples returns the examples found in the files, sorted by Name field. The Order fields record the order in which the examples were encountered.

Playable Examples must be in a package whose name ends in "_test". An Example is "playable" (the Play field is non-nil) in either of these circumstances:

- The example function is self-contained: the function references only
  identifiers from other packages (or predeclared identifiers, such as
  "int") and the test file does not include a dot import.
- The entire test file is the example: the file contains exactly one
  example function, zero test or benchmark functions, and at least one
  top-level function, type, variable, or constant declaration other
  than the example function.

func IsPredeclared

func IsPredeclared(s string) bool

IsPredeclared reports whether s is a predeclared identifier.
func Synopsis

func Synopsis(s string) string

Synopsis returns a cleaned version of the first sentence in s. That sentence ends after the first period followed by space and not preceded by exactly one uppercase letter. The result string has no \n, \r, or \t characters and uses only single spaces between words. If s starts with any of the IllegalPrefixes, the result is the empty string.
func ToHTML

func ToHTML(w io.Writer, text string, words map[string]string)

ToHTML converts comment text to formatted HTML. The comment was prepared by DocReader, so it is known not to have leading, trailing blank lines nor to have trailing spaces at the end of lines. The comment markers have already been removed.

Each span of unindented non-blank lines is converted into a single paragraph. There is one exception to the rule: a span that consists of a single line, is followed by another paragraph span, begins with a capital letter, and contains no punctuation is formatted as a heading.

A span of indented lines is converted into a <pre> block, with the common indent prefix removed.

URLs in the comment text are converted into links; if the URL also appears in the words map, the link is taken from the map (if the corresponding map value is the empty string, the URL is not converted into a link).

Go identifiers that appear in the words map are italicized; if the corresponding map value is not the empty string, it is considered a URL and the word is converted into a link.
func ToText

func ToText(w io.Writer, text string, indent, preIndent string, width int)

ToText prepares comment text for presentation in textual output. It wraps paragraphs of text to width or fewer Unicode code points and then prefixes each line with the indent. In preformatted sections (such as program text), it prefixes each non-blank line with preIndent.
type Example

An Example represents an example function found in a source files.

type Example struct {
        Name        string // name of the item being exemplified
        Doc         string // example function doc string
        Code        ast.Node
        Play        *ast.File // a whole program version of the example
        Comments    []*ast.CommentGroup
        Output      string // expected output
        Unordered   bool
        EmptyOutput bool // expect empty output
        Order       int  // original source code order
}

type Filter

type Filter func(string) bool

type Func

Func is the documentation for a func declaration.

type Func struct {
        Doc  string
        Name string
        Decl *ast.FuncDecl

        // methods
        // (for functions, these fields have the respective zero value)
        Recv  string // actual   receiver "T" or "*T"
        Orig  string // original receiver "T" or "*T"
        Level int    // embedding level; 0 means not embedded
}

type Mode

Mode values control the operation of New.

type Mode int

const (
        // extract documentation for all package-level declarations,
        // not just exported ones
        AllDecls Mode = 1 << iota

        // show all embedded methods, not just the ones of
        // invisible (unexported) anonymous fields
        AllMethods
)

type Note

A Note represents a marked comment starting with "MARKER(uid): note body". Any note with a marker of 2 or more upper case [A-Z] letters and a uid of at least one character is recognized. The ":" following the uid is optional. Notes are collected in the Package.Notes map indexed by the notes marker.

type Note struct {
        Pos, End token.Pos // position range of the comment containing the marker
        UID      string    // uid found with the marker
        Body     string    // note body text
}

type Package

Package is the documentation for an entire package.

type Package struct {
        Doc        string
        Name       string
        ImportPath string
        Imports    []string
        Filenames  []string
        Notes      map[string][]*Note

        // Deprecated: For backward compatibility Bugs is still populated,
        // but all new code should use Notes instead.
        Bugs []string

        // declarations
        Consts []*Value
        Types  []*Type
        Vars   []*Value
        Funcs  []*Func
}

func New

func New(pkg *ast.Package, importPath string, mode Mode) *Package

New computes the package documentation for the given package AST. New takes ownership of the AST pkg and may edit or overwrite it.
func (*Package) Filter

func (p *Package) Filter(f Filter)

Filter eliminates documentation for names that don't pass through the filter f. TODO(gri): Recognize "Type.Method" as a name.
type Type

Type is the documentation for a type declaration.

type Type struct {
        Doc  string
        Name string
        Decl *ast.GenDecl

        // associated declarations
        Consts  []*Value // sorted list of constants of (mostly) this type
        Vars    []*Value // sorted list of variables of (mostly) this type
        Funcs   []*Func  // sorted list of functions returning this type
        Methods []*Func  // sorted list of methods (including embedded ones) of this type
}

type Value

Value is the documentation for a (possibly grouped) var or const declaration.

type Value struct {
        Doc   string
        Names []string // var or const names in declaration order
        Decl  *ast.GenDecl
        // contains filtered or unexported fields
}
