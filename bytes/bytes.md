### <a name="info"></a>Γενικά  

Package bytes implements functions for the manipulation of byte slices. It is analogous to the facilities of the strings package.
### <a name="const"></a>Σταθερές


MinRead is the minimum slice size passed to a Read call by Buffer.ReadFrom. As long as the Buffer has at least MinRead bytes beyond what is required to hold the contents of r, ReadFrom will not grow the underlying buffer.

```golang
const MinRead = 512
```
### <a name="variables"></a>Μεταβλητές 

ErrTooLarge is passed to panic if memory cannot be allocated to store data in a buffer.

```golang
var ErrTooLarge = errors.New("bytes.Buffer: too large")
```

* **func Compare**

```golang
func Compare(a, b []byte) int
```

Compare returns an integer comparing two byte slices lexicographically. The result will be 0 if a==b, -1 if a < b, and +1 if a > b. A nil argument is equivalent to an empty slice.

▹ Example

▹ Example (Search)

* **func Contains**

```golang
func Contains(b, subslice []byte) bool
```

Contains reports whether subslice is within b.

▹ Example

* **func ContainsAny**

```golang
func ContainsAny(b []byte, chars string) bool
```
ContainsAny reports whether any of the UTF-8-encoded Unicode code points in chars are within b.

* **func ContainsRune**

```golang
func ContainsRune(b []byte, r rune) bool
```

ContainsRune reports whether the Unicode code point r is within b.

* **func Count**

```golang
func Count(s, sep []byte) int
```
Count counts the number of non-overlapping instances of sep in s. If sep is an empty slice, Count returns 1 + the number of Unicode code points in s.

▹ Example

* **func Equal**

```golang
func Equal(a, b []byte) bool
```
Equal returns a boolean reporting whether a and b are the same length and contain the same bytes. A nil argument is equivalent to an empty slice.

* **func EqualFold**

```golang
func EqualFold(s, t []byte) bool
```
EqualFold reports whether s and t, interpreted as UTF-8 strings, are equal under Unicode case-folding.

▹ Example

* **func Fields**

```golang
func Fields(s []byte) [][]byte
```

Fields splits the slice s around each instance of one or more consecutive white space characters, returning a slice of subslices of s or an empty list if s contains only white space.

▹ Example

* **func FieldsFunc**

```golang
func FieldsFunc(s []byte, f func(rune) bool) [][]byte
```

FieldsFunc interprets s as a sequence of UTF-8-encoded Unicode code points. It splits the slice s at each run of code points c satisfying f(c) and returns a slice of subslices of s. If all code points in s satisfy f(c), or len(s) == 0, an empty slice is returned. FieldsFunc makes no guarantees about the order in which it calls f(c). If f does not return consistent results for a given c, FieldsFunc may crash.

▹ Example

* **func HasPrefix**

```golang
func HasPrefix(s, prefix []byte) bool
```

HasPrefix tests whether the byte slice s begins with prefix.

▹ Example

* **func HasSuffix**

```golang
func HasSuffix(s, suffix []byte) bool
```

HasSuffix tests whether the byte slice s ends with suffix.

▹ Example

* **func Index**

```golang
func Index(s, sep []byte) int
```

Index returns the index of the first instance of sep in s, or -1 if sep is not present in s.

▹ Example

* **func IndexAny**

```golang
func IndexAny(s []byte, chars string) int
```


IndexAny interprets s as a sequence of UTF-8-encoded Unicode code points. It returns the byte index of the first occurrence in s of any of the Unicode code points in chars. It returns -1 if chars is empty or if there is no code point in common.

▹ Example

* **func IndexByte**

```golang
func IndexByte(s []byte, c byte) int
```

IndexByte returns the index of the first instance of c in s, or -1 if c is not present in s.

* **func IndexFunc**

```golang
func IndexFunc(s []byte, f func(r rune) bool) int
```

IndexFunc interprets s as a sequence of UTF-8-encoded Unicode code points. It returns the byte index in s of the first Unicode code point satisfying f(c), or -1 if none do.

▹ Example
func IndexRune

func IndexRune(s []byte, r rune) int

IndexRune interprets s as a sequence of UTF-8-encoded Unicode code points. It returns the byte index of the first occurrence in s of the given rune. It returns -1 if rune is not present in s. If r is utf8.RuneError, it returns the first instance of any invalid UTF-8 byte sequence.

▹ Example

* **func Join**

```golang
func Join(s [][]byte, sep []byte) []byte
```

Join concatenates the elements of s to create a new byte slice. The separator sep is placed between elements in the resulting slice.

▹ Example

* **func LastIndex**

```golang
func LastIndex(s, sep []byte) int
```

LastIndex returns the index of the last instance of sep in s, or -1 if sep is not present in s.

▹ Example

* **func LastIndexAny**

```golang
func LastIndexAny(s []byte, chars string) int
```

LastIndexAny interprets s as a sequence of UTF-8-encoded Unicode code points. It returns the byte index of the last occurrence in s of any of the Unicode code points in chars. It returns -1 if chars is empty or if there is no code point in common.

* **func LastIndexByte**

```golang
func LastIndexByte(s []byte, c byte) int
```

LastIndexByte returns the index of the last instance of c in s, or -1 if c is not present in s.
* **func LastIndexFunc**

```golang
func LastIndexFunc(s []byte, f func(r rune) bool) int
```

LastIndexFunc interprets s as a sequence of UTF-8-encoded Unicode code points. It returns the byte index in s of the last Unicode code point satisfying f(c), or -1 if none do.

* **func Map**

```golang
func Map(mapping func(r rune) rune, s []byte) []byte
```

Map returns a copy of the byte slice s with all its characters modified according to the mapping function. If mapping returns a negative value, the character is dropped from the string with no replacement. The characters in s and the output are interpreted as UTF-8-encoded Unicode code points.

▹ Example

* **func Repeat**

```golang
func Repeat(b []byte, count int) []byte
```

Repeat returns a new byte slice consisting of count copies of b.

It panics if count is negative or if the result of (len(b) * count) overflows.

▹ Example

* **func Replace**

```golang
func Replace(s, old, new []byte, n int) []byte
```

Replace returns a copy of the slice s with the first n non-overlapping instances of old replaced by new. If old is empty, it matches at the beginning of the slice and after each UTF-8 sequence, yielding up to k+1 replacements for a k-rune slice. If n < 0, there is no limit on the number of replacements.

▹ Example

* **func Runes**

```golang
func Runes(s []byte) []rune
```

Runes returns a slice of runes (Unicode code points) equivalent to s.

* **func Split**

```golang
func Split(s, sep []byte) [][]byte
```

Split slices s into all subslices separated by sep and returns a slice of the subslices between those separators. If sep is empty, Split splits after each UTF-8 sequence. It is equivalent to SplitN with a count of -1.

▹ Example

* **func SplitAfter**

```golang
func SplitAfter(s, sep []byte) [][]byte
```

SplitAfter slices s into all subslices after each instance of sep and returns a slice of those subslices. If sep is empty, SplitAfter splits after each UTF-8 sequence. It is equivalent to SplitAfterN with a count of -1.

▹ Example

* **func SplitAfterN**

```golang
func SplitAfterN(s, sep []byte, n int) [][]byte
```
SplitAfterN slices s into subslices after each instance of sep and returns a slice of those subslices. If sep is empty, SplitAfterN splits after each UTF-8 sequence. The count determines the number of subslices to return:

n > 0: at most n subslices; the last subslice will be the unsplit remainder.
n == 0: the result is nil (zero subslices)
n < 0: all subslices

▹ Example
* **func SplitN**
```golang
func SplitN(s, sep []byte, n int) [][]byte
```

SplitN slices s into subslices separated by sep and returns a slice of the subslices between those separators. If sep is empty, SplitN splits after each UTF-8 sequence. The count determines the number of subslices to return:

n > 0: at most n subslices; the last subslice will be the unsplit remainder.
n == 0: the result is nil (zero subslices)
n < 0: all subslices

▹ Example

* **func Title**

```golang
func Title(s []byte) []byte
```
Title returns a copy of s with all Unicode letters that begin words mapped to their title case.

BUG(rsc): The rule Title uses for word boundaries does not handle Unicode punctuation properly.

▹ Example

* **func ToLower**

```golang
func ToLower(s []byte) []byte
```

ToLower returns a copy of the byte slice s with all Unicode letters mapped to their lower case.

▹ Example

* **func ToLowerSpecial**

```golang
func ToLowerSpecial(c unicode.SpecialCase, s []byte) []byte
```

ToLowerSpecial returns a copy of the byte slice s with all Unicode letters mapped to their lower case, giving priority to the special casing rules.

* **func ToUpper**

```golang
func ToUpper(s []byte) []byte
```
ToUpper returns a copy of the byte slice s with all Unicode letters mapped to their upper case.

▹ Example

* **func ToUpperSpecial**

```golang
func ToUpperSpecial(c unicode.SpecialCase, s []byte) []byte

▹ Example
### type Buffer

A Buffer is a variable-sized buffer of bytes with Read and Write methods. The zero value for Buffer is an empty buffer ready to use.

```golang
type Buffer struct {
        // contains filtered or unexported fields
}
```
▹ Example

▹ Example (Reader)

* **func NewBuffer**

```golang
func NewBuffer(buf []byte) *Buffer
```
NewBuffer creates and initializes a new Buffer using buf as its initial contents. It is intended to prepare a Buffer to read existing data. It can also be used to size the internal buffer for writing. To do that, buf should have the desired capacity but a length of zero.

In most cases, new(Buffer) (or just declaring a Buffer variable) is sufficient to initialize a Buffer.

* **func NewBufferString**
```golang
func NewBufferString(s string) *Buffer
```
NewBufferString creates and initializes a new Buffer using string s as its initial contents. It is intended to prepare a buffer to read an existing string.

In most cases, new(Buffer) (or just declaring a Buffer variable) is sufficient to initialize a Buffer.

* **func (\*Buffer) Bytes**

```golang
func (b *Buffer) Bytes() []byte
```

Bytes returns a slice of length b.Len() holding the unread portion of the buffer. The slice is valid for use only until the next buffer modification (that is, only until the next call to a method like Read, Write, Reset, or Truncate). The slice aliases the buffer content at least until the next buffer modification, so immediate changes to the slice will affect the result of future reads.

* **func (\*Buffer) Cap**

```golang
func (b *Buffer) Cap() int
```
Cap returns the capacity of the buffer's underlying byte slice, that is, the total space allocated for the buffer's data.

* **func (\*Buffer) Grow**

```golang
func (b *Buffer) Grow(n int)
```
Grow grows the buffer's capacity, if necessary, to guarantee space for another n bytes. After Grow(n), at least n bytes can be written to the buffer without another allocation. If n is negative, Grow will panic. If the buffer can't grow it will panic with ErrTooLarge.

* **func (\*Buffer) Len**

```golang
func (b *Buffer) Len() int
```
Len returns the number of bytes of the unread portion of the buffer; b.Len() == len(b.Bytes()).

* **func (\*Buffer) Next**

```golang
func (b *Buffer) Next(n int) []byte
```

Next returns a slice containing the next n bytes from the buffer, advancing the buffer as if the bytes had been returned by Read. If there are fewer than n bytes in the buffer, Next returns the entire buffer. The slice is only valid until the next call to a read or write method.

* **func (\*Buffer) Read**
```golang
func (b *Buffer) Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
```
Read reads the next len(p) bytes from the buffer or until the buffer is drained. The return value n is the number of bytes read. If the buffer has no data to return, err is io.EOF (unless len(p) is zero); otherwise it is nil.

* **func (\*Buffer) ReadByte**

```golang
func (b *Buffer) ReadByte() (byte, error)
```
ReadByte reads and returns the next byte from the buffer. If no byte is available, it returns error io.EOF.

* **func (\*Buffer) ReadBytes**

```golang
func (b *Buffer) ReadBytes(delim byte) (line []byte, err error)
```
ReadBytes reads until the first occurrence of delim in the input, returning a slice containing the data up to and including the delimiter. If ReadBytes encounters an error before finding a delimiter, it returns the data read before the error and the error itself (often io.EOF). ReadBytes returns err != nil if and only if the returned data does not end in delim.

* **func (\*Buffer) ReadFrom**

```golang
func (b *Buffer) ReadFrom(r io.Reader) (n int64, err error)
```

ReadFrom reads data from r until EOF and appends it to the buffer, growing the buffer as needed. The return value n is the number of bytes read. Any error except io.EOF encountered during the read is also returned. If the buffer becomes too large, ReadFrom will panic with ErrTooLarge.

* **func (\*Buffer) ReadRune**

```golang
func (b *Buffer) ReadRune() (r rune, size int, err error)
```

ReadRune reads and returns the next UTF-8-encoded Unicode code point from the buffer. If no bytes are available, the error returned is io.EOF. If the bytes are an erroneous UTF-8 encoding, it consumes one byte and returns U+FFFD, 1.

* **func (\*Buffer) ReadString**

```golang
func (b *Buffer) ReadString(delim byte) (line string, err error)
```

ReadString reads until the first occurrence of delim in the input, returning a string containing the data up to and including the delimiter. If ReadString encounters an error before finding a delimiter, it returns the data read before the error and the error itself (often io.EOF). ReadString returns err != nil if and only if the returned data does not end in delim.

* **func (\*Buffer) Reset**

```golang
func (b *Buffer) Reset()
```

Reset resets the buffer to be empty, but it retains the underlying storage for use by future writes. Reset is the same as Truncate(0).

* **func (\*Buffer) String**

```golang
func (b *Buffer) String() string
```

String returns the contents of the unread portion of the buffer as a string. If the Buffer is a nil pointer, it returns "<nil>".

* **func (\*Buffer) Truncate**

```golang
func (b *Buffer) Truncate(n int)
```

Truncate discards all but the first n unread bytes from the buffer but continues to use the same allocated storage. It panics if n is negative or greater than the length of the buffer.

* **func (\*Buffer) UnreadByte**

```golang
func (b *Buffer) UnreadByte() error
```
UnreadByte unreads the last byte returned by the most recent read operation. If write has happened since the last read, UnreadByte returns an error.

* **func (\*Buffer) UnreadRune**

```golang
func (b *Buffer) UnreadRune() error
```

UnreadRune unreads the last rune returned by ReadRune. If the most recent read or write operation on the buffer was not a ReadRune, UnreadRune returns an error. (In this regard it is stricter than UnreadByte, which will unread the last byte from any read operation.)

* **func (\*Buffer) Write**

```golang
func (b *Buffer) Write(p []byte) (n int, err error)
```

Write appends the contents of p to the buffer, growing the buffer as needed. The return value n is the length of p; err is always nil. If the buffer becomes too large, Write will panic with ErrTooLarge.

* **func (\*Buffer) WriteByte**

```golang
func (b *Buffer) WriteByte(c byte) error
```

WriteByte appends the byte c to the buffer, growing the buffer as needed. The returned error is always nil, but is included to match bufio.Writer's WriteByte. If the buffer becomes too large, WriteByte will panic with ErrTooLarge.

* **func (\*Buffer) WriteRune**

```golang
func (b *Buffer) WriteRune(r rune) (n int, err error)
```

WriteRune appends the UTF-8 encoding of Unicode code point r to the buffer, returning its length and an error, which is always nil but is included to match bufio.Writer's WriteRune. The buffer is grown as needed; if it becomes too large, WriteRune will panic with ErrTooLarge.

* **func (\*Buffer) WriteString**

```golang
func (b *Buffer) WriteString(s string) (n int, err error)
```

WriteString appends the contents of s to the buffer, growing the buffer as needed. The return value n is the length of s; err is always nil. If the buffer becomes too large, WriteString will panic with ErrTooLarge.

* **func (\*Buffer) WriteTo**

```golang
func (b *Buffer) WriteTo(w io.Writer) (n int64, err error)
```

WriteTo writes data to w until the buffer is drained or an error occurs. The return value n is the number of bytes written; it always fits into an int, but it is int64 to match the io.WriterTo interface. Any error encountered during the write is also returned.

### type Reader

A Reader implements the io.Reader, io.ReaderAt, io.WriterTo, io.Seeker, io.ByteScanner, and io.RuneScanner interfaces by reading from a byte slice. Unlike a Buffer, a Reader is read-only and supports seeking.

```golang
type Reader struct {
        // contains filtered or unexported fields
}
```

* **func NewReader**

```golang
func NewReader(b []byte) *Reader
```
NewReader returns a new Reader reading from b.

* **func (\*Reader) Len**

```golang
func (r *Reader) Len() int
```

Len returns the number of bytes of the unread portion of the slice.

* **func (\*Reader) Read**

```golang
func (r *Reader) Read(b []byte) (n int, err error)
```

* **func (\*Reader) ReadAt**

```golang
func (r *Reader) ReadAt(b []byte, off int64) (n int, err error)
```

* **func (\*Reader) ReadByte**

```golang
func (r *Reader) ReadByte() (byte, error)
```

* **func (\*Reader) ReadRune**

```golang
func (r *Reader) ReadRune() (ch rune, size int, err error)
```

* **func (\*Reader) Reset**
```golang
func (r *Reader) Reset(b []byte)
```
Reset resets the Reader to be reading from b.
* **func (\*Reader) Seek**

```golang
func (r *Reader) Seek(offset int64, whence int) (int64, error)
```
Seek implements the io.Seeker interface.

* **func (\*Reader) Size**

```golang
func (r *Reader) Size() int64
```

Size returns the original length of the underlying byte slice. Size is the number of bytes available for reading via ReadAt. The returned value is always the same and is not affected by calls to any other method.

* **func (\*Reader) UnreadByte**
```golang
func (r *Reader) UnreadByte() error
```

* **func (\*Reader) UnreadRune**
```golang
func (r *Reader) UnreadRune() error
```

* **func (\*Reader) WriteTo**
```golang
func (r *Reader) WriteTo(w io.Writer) (n int64, err error)
```
WriteTo implements the io.WriterTo interface.
```bash
Bugs
    The rule Title uses for word boundaries does not handle Unicode punctuation properly.
