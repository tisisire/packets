### <a name="info"></a>Γενικά  

Package utf8 implements functions and constants to support text encoded in UTF-8. It includes functions to translate between runes and UTF-8 byte sequences.
### <a name="const"></a>Σταθερές

Numbers fundamental to the encoding.

```golang
const (
        RuneError = '\uFFFD'     // the "error" Rune or "Unicode replacement character"
        RuneSelf  = 0x80         // characters below Runeself are represented as themselves in a single byte.
        MaxRune   = '\U0010FFFF' // Maximum valid Unicode code point.
        UTFMax    = 4            // maximum number of bytes of a UTF-8 encoded Unicode character.
)
```

* **func DecodeLastRune**

```golang
func DecodeLastRune(p []byte) (r rune, size int)
```
DecodeLastRune unpacks the last UTF-8 encoding in p and returns the rune and its width in bytes. If p is empty it returns (RuneError, 0). Otherwise, if the encoding is invalid, it returns (RuneError, 1). Both are impossible results for correct, non-empty UTF-8.

An encoding is invalid if it is incorrect UTF-8, encodes a rune that is out of range, or is not the shortest possible UTF-8 encoding for the value. No other validation is performed.

▹ Example
* **func DecodeLastRuneInString**

```golang
func DecodeLastRuneInString(s string) (r rune, size int)
```
DecodeLastRuneInString is like DecodeLastRune but its input is a string. If s is empty it returns (RuneError, 0). Otherwise, if the encoding is invalid, it returns (RuneError, 1). Both are impossible results for correct, non-empty UTF-8.

An encoding is invalid if it is incorrect UTF-8, encodes a rune that is out of range, or is not the shortest possible UTF-8 encoding for the value. No other validation is performed.

▹ Example
* **func DecodeRune**
```golang
func DecodeRune(p []byte) (r rune, size int)
```
DecodeRune unpacks the first UTF-8 encoding in p and returns the rune and its width in bytes. If p is empty it returns (RuneError, 0). Otherwise, if the encoding is invalid, it returns (RuneError, 1). Both are impossible results for correct, non-empty UTF-8.

An encoding is invalid if it is incorrect UTF-8, encodes a rune that is out of range, or is not the shortest possible UTF-8 encoding for the value. No other validation is performed.

▹ Example
* **func DecodeRuneInString**

```golang
func DecodeRuneInString(s string) (r rune, size int)
```
DecodeRuneInString is like DecodeRune but its input is a string. If s is empty it returns (RuneError, 0). Otherwise, if the encoding is invalid, it returns (RuneError, 1). Both are impossible results for correct, non-empty UTF-8.

An encoding is invalid if it is incorrect UTF-8, encodes a rune that is out of range, or is not the shortest possible UTF-8 encoding for the value. No other validation is performed.

▹ Example
* **func EncodeRune**

```golang
func EncodeRune(p []byte, r rune) int
```
EncodeRune writes into p (which must be large enough) the UTF-8 encoding of the rune. It returns the number of bytes written.

▹ Example
* **func FullRune**

```golang
func FullRune(p []byte) bool
```
FullRune reports whether the bytes in p begin with a full UTF-8 encoding of a rune. An invalid encoding is considered a full Rune since it will convert as a width-1 error rune.

▹ Example
* **func FullRuneInString**

```golang
func FullRuneInString(s string) bool
```
FullRuneInString is like FullRune but its input is a string.

▹ Example
* **func RuneCount**

```golang
func RuneCount(p []byte) int
```
RuneCount returns the number of runes in p. Erroneous and short encodings are treated as single runes of width 1 byte.

▹ Example
* **func RuneCountInString**

```golang
func RuneCountInString(s string) (n int)
```
RuneCountInString is like RuneCount but its input is a string.

▹ Example
* **func RuneLen**

```golang
func RuneLen(r rune) int
```
RuneLen returns the number of bytes required to encode the rune. It returns -1 if the rune is not a valid value to encode in UTF-8.

▹ Example
* **func RuneStart**

```golang
func RuneStart(b byte) bool
```
RuneStart reports whether the byte could be the first byte of an encoded, possibly invalid rune. Second and subsequent bytes always have the top two bits set to 10.

▹ Example
* **func Valid**

```golang
func Valid(p []byte) bool
```
Valid reports whether p consists entirely of valid UTF-8-encoded runes.

▹ Example
* **func ValidRune**

```golang
func ValidRune(r rune) bool
```
ValidRune reports whether r can be legally encoded as UTF-8. Code points that are out of range or a surrogate half are illegal.

▹ Example
* **func ValidString**
```golang
func ValidString(s string) bool
```
ValidString reports whether s consists entirely of valid UTF-8-encoded runes.
